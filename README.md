# Digit-Recognision
This project aims at doing digit recognision using different models and compare them.

This is self project.

## In this project I have used -
1. Linear Regression
2. Polynomial Regression
3. Guassian Basis Regression
4. Fourier Features Regression
5. Logistic Regression
6. Random Forest
7. K Means
8. Neural Networks
9. Convolutional Neural Network
10. Support Vector Machine

## Observations - 
1. Got more than 90% accuracy in Logistic Regression, Random Forest, K Means, Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Network, Support Vector Machine models which is good.
2. According to time K Means is giving the best results.
3. According to accuracy CNN and SVM are giving the best results.
